# Market_Calls_Android
An android application that implements a navigation drawer, GMailSender and a ViewPager loaded on to the navigation drawer fragment

Created a sample android application which shows stock market tips. 
Has a login activity which also implements the GMailSender.
The main framework for the app uses a navigation drawer that loads different fragments as per functionality.
The Dashboard Fragment implements a ViewPager and to show two different pages for stock tips that are either "open" or "closed".
